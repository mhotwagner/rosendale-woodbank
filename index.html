      <h2 class="section-title">The Problem</h2>
      <p class="body">
        A lot of households in our area heat with wood — and a full winter's supply of
        seasoned hardwood costs <strong>$1,000 to $1,600</strong> at current prices. For
        families already stretched thin by groceries, medical expenses, and today's
        generally high cost of living, that's an impossible number. New York's HEA
        heating assistance covers a portion, but not enough for a full season.
        Every winter, people in our community go cold.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="section-title">The Idea</h2>
      <p class="body">
        A woodbank works like a food pantry, but for firewood. Volunteers collect,
        split, season, and distribute free cordwood to households that can't afford to
        heat their homes. There are over 200 woodbanks operating across the country,
        many of them small, volunteer-run operations serving a handful of families in
        their own towns. We'd like to start one here.
      </p>
      <p class="body">
        The concept is straightforward: source wood that would otherwise go to waste —
        storm damage, tree service removals, hazard trees, land clearing — and turn it
        into split, seasoned firewood for people who need it.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="section-title">What We Have So Far</h2>
      <p class="body">
        We have a chainsaw, a hydraulic splitter, a truck to haul with, and a small
        group of people willing to put in the work. Federal grant funding exists
        specifically for woodbank startups through the USDA Forest Service's Firewood
        Bank Assistance Program, and several national organizations offer mentorship and
        resources to new programs.

          <div class="need-title">A Processing Site</div>
          <p class="body">
            This is our biggest need. We're looking for a flat, truck-accessible area —
            ideally in or near Rosendale — where we can store logs, run a splitter on
            processing days, and stack split wood to dry. A corner of a farm, a municipal
            yard, church property, or an unused commercial lot would all work. It doesn't
            need to be fancy. It needs to be accessible and available.

            Processing firewood is physical work and it goes a lot faster with a crew.
            We'd hold regular processing days — likely weekend mornings — where people can
            show up, split and stack wood, and go home knowing they helped a neighbor stay
            warm. No experience necessary. All safety equipment and training provided.

      <h2 class="section-title">How It Would (Wood) Work</h2>
      <p class="body">
        Wood is collected from local sources — tree services, storm cleanup, private
        landowners, and potentially state and county operations — and brought to the
        processing site. Volunteers buck logs to stove length and split them, then stack
        the wood to season over spring and summer. By fall, the firewood is dry and
        ready to distribute.
      </p>
      <p class="body">
        Distribution would begin in October and run through March, prioritizing elderly
        residents, people with disabilities, families with young children, and anyone in
        an emergency heating situation. Recipients can pick up wood at the site or, for
        those without transportation, we'd deliver.
      </p>
      <p class="body">
        Eligibility would be based on need — we're not interested in creating
        bureaucratic hurdles. <em>If you're struggling to heat your home, that's enough.</em>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="section-title">Who Benefits</h2>
      <p class="body">
        Beyond the families who receive firewood, a woodbank creates value across the
        community. Tree services get a free, local dump site for logs they'd otherwise
        pay to dispose of. The town gets a productive use for storm debris. Volunteers
        get a tangible way to help their neighbors. And all of us benefit from knowing
        that nobody in our community is going without heat.

        We're in the early stages and looking for all kinds of support — a place to
        work, people to work with, wood to work on, and ideas to work from. If any part

        Woodbanks are community-driven, volunteer-powered programs. This initiative is
        not affiliated with any commercial firewood operation. All firewood distributed
        through the program would be free of charge to eligible households.
